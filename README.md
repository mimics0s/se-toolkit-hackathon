## About the lab

Lab opens with a [quiz](#quiz) and then kicks off the [hackathon](#hackathon).

You must complete both to get the full point for Lab 9.

During the lab:

<!-- no toc -->
- Write a [quiz](#quiz)
- Get your [idea](#ideation) and [plan](#planning) approved by the TA

By Thursday 23:59, complete:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Implementation](#implementation)
- [Delivery](#delivery)

## Quiz

Pen and paper quiz.

- Closed-book, no devices allowed.
- You get random 3 questions from the question bank (available on Moodle).
- Answer at least 2 out of 3 correctly.

## Hackathon

Each student goes from own idea to own deployed product.

Tasks:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Ideation](#ideation)
2. [Planning](#planning)
3. [Implementation](#implementation)
4. [Delivery](#delivery)

> [!NOTE]
>
> We simplify definitions because you'll study these concepts more in-depth during the SWP course.

### Ideation

Define:

- End users of the product
- Which problem your product solves for the end users
- The product idea

The product idea must be:

- Easy to explain in one sentence
- Easy to implement using an agent
- Clearly solve the problem for end users
- Different from the project used in SET labs

The product must have at least these components:

- The nanobot agent
- Frontend
- Backend
- Database

Each component must:

- Interact with at least one other component
- Be necessary for solving the end users' problem

### Requirements elicitation

#### Define stakeholders

A stakeholder is a person affected by the project.

List all stakeholders of your project (including yourself).

During the hackathon, assume that end users are your main stakeholders and focus on them.

#### Write requirements

A requirement is a testable statement about the project.

Each satisfied requirement makes the product more valuable to particular stakeholders.

Write a list of user stories for the main product features.

A user story specifies:

1. The persona who wants the feature
2. What the feature is
3. Which value the feature brings to the persona
  
> 🟪 **Example**
>
> As a DevOps team member,
>
> I want the chatbot to answer questions about logs and traces
>
> so that I can analyze incidents without writing `LogsQL` by hand

Prioritize the user stories focusing on the end users.

### Planning

For each each product version, specify which requirements will be covered in it:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Proof of concept](#proof-of-concept)
2. [Prototype](#prototype)
3. [Minimal valuable product](#minimal-valuable-product)

### Implementation

#### Proof of concept

Perform the minimal work to prove that your idea is technically feasible.

The sooner you learn what doesn't work, the less work you spend uselessly.

> **Example**
>
> If you want to develop a Telegram bot, check that the simplest bot works when hosted on the University VM.

#### Prototype

Implement an interactive prototype to learn how the product will look like and feel and which parts can break the user experience.

> 🟪 **Example**
>
> If you want to develop a chatbot, add support for main scenarios of end user's interaction with the chatbot.
>
> E.g., add buttons and minimal logic to handle clicks on these buttons.
>
> Use mocks to simplify the implementation.

> [!TIP]
>
> Use `Build` in `Google AI Studio`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The prototype shouldn't necessarily use the technologies that will be used in the MVP. For example, you can prototype everything in `TypeScript` but use a real database and `Python` in the MVP.
>
> It's OK to throw the prototype away and design a better solution where you account for everything you learned.

#### Minimal valuable product

Implement your product, fully covering the most important requirements.

Dockerize all services.

Deploy the product so that it's accessible by course instructors and students from the university network.

### Delivery

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Submit a presentation on `Moodle`](#submit-a-presentation-on-moodle)
2. [Publish the product code on `GitHub`](#publish-the-product-code-on-github)

#### Submit a presentation on `Moodle`

Submit on Moodle a 5-minute presentation with at most ten slides:

- Title slide:
  - Product title
  - Your name
  - Your university email
  - Your group

- Agenda slide:
  - List of sections in the presentation

- Context slide(s):
  - Your end users
  - The problem of end users you are solving
  - Your solution

- Implementation slide(s):
  - How you built the product

- Demo slide(s):
  - Pre-recorded demo with live commentaries (no longer than 2 minutes)

- Final slide:
  - Link and QR code for each of these:
    - The GitHub repo with the product code
    - Product deployed on a VM

#### Publish the product code on `GitHub`

- Publish the product code in a repository on `GitHub`.

  The repository name must be `se-toolkit-<product-name>` (without `<` and `>`).

- Add the MIT license file to make your product truly free and open-source.

- Add `README.md` in the product repository.
  
  Recommended structure of the `README.md`:
  
  - Product name
  
  - One-line description
  
  - Demo:
    - A couple of relevant screenshots of the product

  - Product context:

    - End users
    - Problem that your product solves for end users
    - Your solution
  
  - Usage:

    - Explain how to use your product
  
  - Deployment:

    - Which OS the VM should run (you may assume `Ubuntu 24.04` like on your university VMs)
    - What should be installed on the VM
    - Step-by-step deployment instructions
