# Lab 9 - Quiz and Hackathon

Lab opens with a quiz and then kicks off the hackathon.

To get the full point for the lab, you need to:
- Pass Tasks 1, 2, 3 during the lab AND 
- Finish Task 4 and 5 by the usual deadline of Thursday 23:59.

Each student builds their own project:
- Go from an idea to a deployed product.
- Use agents and LLMs throughout.

----

## Task 1 (graded by TA after the lab).
Pen and paper quiz:
- 20 mins;
- closed book, no devices;
- you get random 3 questions from the question bank;
- answer at least 2.

## Task 2 (approved by TA during the lab).

Ideate and plan your project.


### Project idea
The project idea must be:
- something simple to build;
- clearly useful;
- easy to explain.

Define and show to your TA:
- End-user of the product
- Which problem your product solves for the end-user / what is its core feature?
- The product idea in one short sentence

### Implementation plan

When the idea is approved, produce a plan for two product versions.

Version 1 does one core thing well:
- Pick one feature most valuable to the end-user and relatively easy to implement;
- It is a functioning product, not a prototype;
- Needs to be shown to the TA upon completion for feedback.

Version 2 builds upon Version 1:
- improves the initial feature, or adds another one on top;
- address TA feedback from the lab;
- deploy and make it available to use.

Important to note:
- The product must have these components each fulfilling a useful function: Backend, Database, and User-facing Client (web, mobile or LLM-powered agent, e.g. `nanobot`).
- You can use the setup from Lab 8 or start from scratch.
- `Telegram` bots are being blocked on university VMs.

## Task 3 (approved by TA during the lab).

Implement Version 1 outlined in the plan:
- Build one core feature;
- Follow best practices and git workflow;
- Test it yourself and fix bugs;
- Have the TA try it as a user;
- Take note of the TA feedback;
- Get TA's approval for the task to be marked as DONE.


## Task 4

Implement and deploy Version 2 outlined in the plan:
- Build and polish functionality;
- Take TA feedback into account;
- Push all code to the github repo (see the detailed instructions below);
- Follow best practices and git workflow;
- Document your solution;
- Dockerize all services;
- Deploy it to be accessible to use.

Version 2 can be done during the lab or after the lab before the usual deadline.


## Task 5 (demo and pdf submitted through moodle)
Submit presentation with five slides:

1. Title:
  - Product title
  - Your name
  - Your university email
  - Your group

2. Context:
  - End-user of the product
  - Which problem your product solves
  - The product idea in one short sentence

3. Implementation:
  - How you built the product
  - What went into Version 1 and Version 2
  - What TA feedback points you addressed

4. Demo:
  - Pre-recorded video demonstration of Product version 2 with pre-recorded voice commentary (no longer than 2 minutes).
  - _Note:_ **This is the most important part of the presentation**.

5. Links:
  - Link and QR code for each of these:
    - The GitHub repo with the product code
    - Deployed product (latest version)

----

## Publishing the product code on GitHub

- Publish the product code in a repository on `GitHub`.

  The repository name must be called `se-toolkit-hackathon`.

- Add the MIT license file to make your product open-source.

- Add `README.md` in the product repository.

  `README.md` structure:

  - Product name (as title)

  - One-line description

  - Demo:
    - A couple of relevant screenshots of the product

  - Product context:

    - End users
    - Problem that your product solves for end users
    - Your solution

  - Features:

    - Implemented and not not yet implemented features

  - Usage:

    - Explain how to use your product

  - Deployment:

    - Which OS the VM should run (you may assume `Ubuntu 24.04` like on your university VMs)
    - What should be installed on the VM
    - Step-by-step deployment instructions
